# The following configurations specify which fragment "types" are

#
# If a change applies to more than one type, select the one it most
# applies to. Or, if applicable, multiple changelog fragments can be
# added for one PR. For example, if a PR includes a breaking change
# around some feature, but also fixes a bug in the same part of the
# code but is tangential to the breaking change, a separate
# fragment can be added to call out the fix.

# A change that is incompatible with prior versions which
# requires users to make adjustments.
