#![deny(warnings)]

//! This module contains all of the logic for paths.
//!
//! Paths can be thought of as similar to file paths (in an operating system) pointing
//! to specific files inside of a directory.
//! A `Value` is a data structure that can contain recursively nested fields. Paths
//! allow referring to a specific field inside of a `Value`.
//!
//! # Example
//! Below is a sample `Value`. Different fields can be accessed with paths.
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "foo": {
//!       "bar": 1
//!    },
//!    "baz": ["a", "b", "c"]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! | path   | value it points to                    |
//! |--------|---------------------------------------|
//! | `.foo.bar` | `1`
//! | `.foo` | `{ "bar": 1 }`
//! | `.`    | `{ "foo" : { "bar" : 1 }, "baz" : ["a", "b", "c"] }`
//! | `.baz[0]` | `"a"`
//! | `.baz` | `["a", "b", "c"]`
//!
//!
//! # Traits
//! There are 2 main traits that define a path. Most functions that use a path for querying
//! will require one of these traits, rather than a concrete type.
//!
//! - [ValuePath] is a path that points to a field inside of a `Value`.
//! - [TargetPath] is a path that points to a field inside of a `target`. A `target` in VRL refers to
//! the external data being processed by a VRL script. A `target` has two main sections that can be
//! pointed to, `event` and `metadata`.  [TargetPath::prefix] identifies the section, and
//! [TargetPath::value_path] is a [ValuePath] pointing into that section.
//!
//! Note that for performance reasons, since [ValuePath] and [TargetPath] require [Clone], these
//! traits are only implemented on types that are cheap to clone (usually references). That means
//! when passing in a value (e.g. [OwnedValuePath]) into a function that requires `impl ValuePath`,
//! it will generally need to be passed in as a reference.
//!
//! # Owned Paths
//! [OwnedValuePath] and [OwnedTargetPath] are pre-parsed paths. That means that accessing fields
//! using an owned path is very fast. There is an upfront cost however, since owned paths are parsed
//! when they are created, and the segments are heap allocated. Owned paths should be preferred
//! if they can be created when performance isn't as much of a concern (e.g. startup time)
//! and they can be stored for re-use.
//! Owned paths tend to be easier to work with since you can directly access / manipulate the
//! segments that make up the path.
//!
//! If a path is being created and will only be used once, it may make sense to use other types.
//! For example here are two different ways to append a segment to a [OwnedValuePath]  before querying
//! a `Value`:
//! - Use [OwnedValuePath::with_field_appended] to create a new [OwnedValuePath] and use that. This
//! method is preferred if the new path will be used multiple times and the path adjustment can be
//! done in a non performance-critical part of the code (e.g. at startup).
//! - Use [ValuePath::concat] which con concatenate two [ValuePath]'s very efficiently without
//! allocating on the heap.
//!
//! To convert a string into an owned path, use either [parse_value_path] or [parse_target_path].
//!
//! # String Paths
//! [ValuePath] and [TargetPath] are implemented for [&str]. That means a raw / unparsed string can
//! be used as a path. This use is discouraged, and may be removed in the future. It mostly
//! exists for backwards compatibility in places where String paths are used instead of owned paths.
//! Using string paths is slightly slower than using an owned path. It's still very fast
//! but it is easy to introduce bugs since some compile-time type information is missing -
//! such as whether it is a target vs value path, or if the entire string is meant
//!  to be treated as a single segment vs being parsed as a path.
//!
//! # Macros
//! Several macros exist to make creating paths easier. These are used if the structure of the
//! path being created is already known. <strong>The macros do not parse paths</strong>. Use
//! [parse_value_path] or [parse_target_path] instead if the path needs to be parsed.
//!
//! You need to pass in each segment into the macro as separate arguments. A single argument is treated as
//! a single segment. This is true for all of the path macros.
//!
//! For example, [owned_value_path!][crate::owned_value_path] can be used to easily created owned paths.
//! - `owned_value_path!("foo.bar", "x")` will create a path with *two* segments. Equivalent to `."foo.bar".x`
//!
