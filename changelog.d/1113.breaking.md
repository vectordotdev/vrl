Currently if a grok filter as part of a `parse_groks` operation fails to apply due to an error against the input, the error is not surfaced and the field the filter applies to is not parsed, leading to data loss.

This fix corrects that to surface errors while applying the grok filters.

Existing parse_grok rules may need to be adjusted in order to correct filter queries that are now correctly surfaced as errors.
