Faster converting bytes to Unicode string by using SIMD instructions provided by simdutf8 crate.
simdutf8 is up to 23 times faster than the std library on valid non-ASCII, up to four times on pure
ASCII is the same method provided by Rust's standard library. This will speed up almost all VRL methods
like `parse_json` or `parse_regex`.
