Added two new cryptographic functions `encrypt_ip` and `decrypt_ip` for IP address encryption

These functions use the IPCrypt specification and support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with two encryption modes: `aes128` (IPCrypt deterministic, 16-byte key) and `pfx` (IPCryptPfx, 32-byte key). Both algorithms are format-preserving (output is a valid IP address) and deterministic.
