If you only use VRL within Vector, this change does not affect you. This only affects users who use VRL as a library or have external implementations of the `VrlValueConvert` trait.

Upgraded `ordered-float` dependency from 4.6.0 to 5.1.0. Also added a new required method `try_into_notnan_f64()` to the public `VrlValueConvert` trait.
