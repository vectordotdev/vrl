This PR introduces an unused expression checker. This new module provides functionality for traversing
VRL (Vector Remap Language) Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). It's designed to detect and report unused expressions,
helping users clean up and optimize their VRL scripts. Initially, it will generate warnings for unused expressions. 
These warnings might be escalated to errors in future versions, once the module has been battle-tested.

Implementation caveats:
- **Closures**: Closure support is minimal. For now, we are only ensuring that there are no false positives.
- **Variable Shadowing**: Variable shadowing is not supported. Unused variables will not be detected in this case.
