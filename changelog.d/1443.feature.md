Add `validate_json_schema` function for validating JSON payloads against JSON schema files. A optional configuration parameter `ignore_unknown_formats` is provided to change how custom formats are handled by the validator. Unknown formats can be silently ignored by setting this to `true` and validation continues without failing due to those fields.
