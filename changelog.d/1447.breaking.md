`encode_lz4`  no longer prepends the uncompressed size by default, improving compatibility with standard LZ4 tools. A new `prepend_size` flag restores the old behavior if needed. Also, `decode_lz4` now also accepts `prepend_size` and a `buf_size` option (default: 1MB). 

Existing users of `encode_lz4` and `decode_lz4` will need to update their functions to include the argument `prepend_size: true` to maintain existing compatibility.
