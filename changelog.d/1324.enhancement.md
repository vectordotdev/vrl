Added support for excluded_boundaries in the `snakecase()` function. This allows users to leverage the same function `snakecase()` that they're already leveraging but tune it to handle specific scenarios where default boundaries are not desired.

For example,

```rust
snakecase("s3BucketDetails", excluded_boundaries: ["digit_lower", "lower_digit", "upper_digit"])
/// Output: s3_bucket_details
```
