The `parse_cef` now trims unnecessary whitespace around escaped values in both headers and extension fields, improving accuracy and reliability when dealing with messy input strings.

Scenario: `parse_cef` with whitespace post cef fields

Previous Behavior: Runtime Error

If an input with space added to parse_cef was provided, it would result in a runtime error due to the inability to parse the line successfully.
Input: `CEF:1|Security|threatmanager|1.0|100|worm successfully stopped|10| dst=2.1.2.2 msg=Detected a threat. No action needed spt=1232`
Output:
```
error[E000]: function call error for "parse_cef" at (0:20): Could not parse whole line successfully
  ┌─ :1:1

New Behavior: parses data correctly
